## Part 1: Design

We're starting at Design, but you don't have to. When solving existing problems, or creating something completely new, you can start from anywhere. 

Many books like this typically start with an “inspiration” or “design” phase as a starting point. There is something romantic about looking at creativity as happening via *one little spark* that later turns into something bigger.

**Amazing products and solutions don’t work like that.** 

"Creation," and it's closely-related cousin, "problem-solving," is a process, but not one with a clear start and end. It’s a cycle. 

It’s critically important to understand that the creation cycle can be entered *(or unceremoniously exited)* at any point. 

**With respect to creating and problem-solving, there is no starting point- which is just another way to say that you can start from anywhere.**

This book primarily focuses on Walt Disney World in Florida, which was Disney’s second theme park effort. While a lot of the innovation discussed here was first done in Florida, even Disney World itself was just another piece of a larger creative cycle.
At some point, you've probably had a good idea and lamented *I wish we knew about this earlier*. Knowing something earlier doesn't matter. You know it now, and now is a perfectly good time to start creating.
