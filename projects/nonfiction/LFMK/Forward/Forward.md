`My favorite place to sit at Epcot - in the shade, at the Japan pavilion.`


Having spent a lot of time at the Walt Disney World parks, and a lot of time working complex problems in industry, I’ve noticed that there are lessons to be learned from what Disney has done, which may be applicable elsewhere. 

Where elsewhere? An amazing amount of places and ways. There’s a lot of wisdom to be gathered from the happiest place on Earth; and that wisdom is surprisingly versatile. On these pages I distill what I’ve learned, and show you how to apply it, as best I can. 

Almost needless to say, I do go into some depth on how the Disney Parks “work.” As such, there’s plenty of information in this book that’s NSFM (Not Safe For Magic). You have been warned.

### What is this book, Really?

Most of my experience in industry has dealt with software development and systems engineering efforts. I’ve done a lot of boots-on-the-ground production support, and a fair amount of requirements gathering, analysis, and system design also. 
Due to my background, it would be really easy for me to write this book relating observations at Disney directly to the software development world, and only the software development world. The thing is, though, I’m certain these lessons are applicable far beyond developing software. 

There is wisdom here that works for just about any enterprise, regardless of organization, technology used, or motivation behind the efforts. 

Additionally, the systems engineering and software development world itself is very vast in scope and techniques. There are very few pieces of advice that directly apply to all aspects of systems engineering or software development - and even if there were things that could be directly related now, the world changes so fast these lessons may not be relatable in the same way later.

The “in the same way” bit is important. I believe wisdom, like what can be gathered at the Disney Parks, can transcend domains and specific situations or implementations. 
All it takes is a little creativity and exposure to a few different ways of thinking to be able to relate good ideas in new ways.

In order to make the best of the ideas and concepts available to us at Disney (and all over the world), it’s important to actively develop and always look to improve our own abilities to gather wisdom from many places, and understand it well enough to apply it to our unique situations. 

**I feel the ability to gather wisdom from anywhere and leverage it any way we can is a *superpower*.** 

You probably aren’t dealing with the problems of running a theme park, but you probably are a problem-solver. 

While there are valuable Lessons From The Magic Kingdom in this book, I also hope to help you learn to see what others may not, and process what you see such that you can use it to do great things to improve your world.

#### What Wisdom to Gather

Many people associate gathering wisdom with gathering rote knowledge. I equate gathering wisdom with gaining understanding of overall concepts. This conceptual understanding is very different than gathering rote knowledge of concrete specific information. 

In addition to my time in industry, and my time in theme parks, I’m also a trained aircraft pilot. Technically I’m a “Commercial Single and Multi-engine Instrument Airplane” pilot. I was also a certified flight instructor, but I have allowed that certification to lapse. 

I’ve gained a lot of wisdom I use in industry from flying. I have a full appreciation for the value of checklists, and how they limit mistakes. I understand how the complex systems in an aircraft interact with each other, and therefore I’ve found it easier to understand how complex information systems interact, and where failure points could be. I’ve applied the flying concept of the “Accident Chain” - where several things have to go wrong before a bad outcome occurs - to understanding failures at the office. 

Aviation shows us that **there are very few mistakes or failures that will cause an accident on their own.** 

Almost every accident is the result of several mistakes. Therefore, the way to avoid accidents is to get good at identifying and correcting an accident chain before it becomes unrecoverable. This concept is very applicable to daily life on nearly any project, aviation-related or not. 

The “Accident Chain” concept is the valuable piece of information to take from aviation to other areas of life. There are a few others, such as the value of procedures and checklists, guidelines for effective communication, etcetera. The big one is being able to identify and thwart accident chains, regardless of what domain you are working in.

The concrete specifics about aviation that I learned during my training are typically less valuable in other domains. 

You are not going to save your project from a bad decision because you know the stall speed of a Cessna Citation. 

The specifics don’t help you in this case. You may save your project from a bad decision if you’ve learned the “accident chain” concept from aviation.

It’s important when you gather wisdom that you focus on retaining the overall ideas. Good understanding of a good concept, sometimes even when the concept is fairly vague or ambiguous, is incredibly valuable. 

**Concepts are flexible to new situations. Specifics usually aren’t.**

Some of the lessons presented in this book are intentionally vague, because if we get too specific with an idea, it can limit how you can apply that idea in the future. 

When you’re out in the world, look for generics. Look for ideas, processes, and designs that can exist outside their current implementation. Be sure to look everywhere. This world of ours is incredible, the simplest things often hold some of the biggest ideas.

#### Where to Gather Wisdom

Everywhere. 

Every situation, every product, every experience has something you can learn from it. 

We often focus on learning from mistakes, which is a good idea. Don't stop there, though. You can learn a lot - possibly more - when things go *well.*

When something goes right, anywhere, it almost certainly didn't "go right" by mistake. Good experiences don't happen by mistake, good products don't become good products by mistake. 

**Quality doesn't happen by mistake.**

It's typically the small things that separate a good product or experience from a bad or otherwise lackluster one - so you have to actively look for the small things in order to find the lessons they carry. We all notice the "bad stuff." "Bad stuff" is simply easier to see. It's easy to see a mistake or oversight, but it's *not* easy to see the extra forethought or design that went into avoiding, or preferably, *entirely circumventing*, a potentially bad path. 

These small things range from blink-and-you'll-miss-it events to fundamental design or process affecting concepts that seamlessly blend into the background of the completed product. You have to look close.

When examining a quality product, it's often hard to figure out what makes the quality product so much better than the lower quality competitors. The reason this is difficult is that it's rarely *one big thing* that makes one product better than another. Instead, it's a lot of *little things* that add up to something greater than the sum of the parts. 

#### Active Appreciation

Learning from something that went wrong is relatively easy.

Learning from something that's gone *right* requires time and focus, as you need to look for the small things that brought it all together. Finding time is hard enough. Finding focus is nearly impossible.

This world is full of amazing solutions and concepts already built that we can learn from if we try. It is also full of things constantly screaming for our attention. There are more devices and content trying to distract us from the here-and-now than ever. Our own minds work against us, wandering off into other thoughts, worries, daydreams, or threatening to shut down entirely at the mere concept of experiencing boredom. 

I have a few techniques for keeping me focused on the here-and-now, so I can notice the small things. By far, the most effective trick I use is something I call "Active Appreciation."  I take a moment to appreciate and thank people and things as they happen. It works like this-

*Every time a waiter or waitress brings something to my table at a restaurant, I thank them.* 

Aside from just being polite, it stops my train of thought, my actions, and any conversations at the table - and it resets the focus, even if just for a moment, on the here-and-now. It allows us to look at the table and see what we've been given, arrange the plates properly, and appreciate (and *evaluate*) the food we are about to put in our bodies. Since I started doing this, I've been eating a lot healthier. 

Marie Kondo's KonMari method of tidying up includes *thanking* objects you've decided to let go. You stop and take a moment to thank the thing you are removing from your life. "Thanking" the item gives you the here-and-now moment needed to reflect on your time with the item, it's qualities and uses, and why you've decided to let it go. It's a great trick, because once you've had that moment, you are much less likely to regret getting rid of the item later. 

My technique of "Active Appreciation" is very similar. I thank the products and experiences around me when things go well, and in that moment of appreciating the product or situation, I find a little focus which may help me notice something about it which may help me solve other problems elsewhere. 

The best part of this approach is that all you need to do is remember to thank the person, product or situation when something goes well. It activates your focus exactly when you need it; helping you to find wisdom from something going *right* instead of only when something goes *wrong*.


#### Finding Better Solutions

There are no “Solved Problems”

Every problem you solve every day is unique. Whether you fully realize it or not, your problem and situation is truly unique, every time.

Problem-solvers love to assume that certain problems, and classes of problems, are already “solved problems.” The assumption is that there are known solutions out there for whatever you’re dealing with. This is never actually true.

Yes, people have solve problems like your problem. And yes, you certainly should go look at their solution and gather the wisdom and good concepts you can from those efforts. Ignoring the past is a super bad idea. 
But -

**Your problem is unique.**

It’s now. It has elements that didn’t exist before. Different places, people, equipment, environmental conditions and culture are involved than were involved when the similar issue was solved previously. One size does not fit all. 

You can apply the ideas and concepts from a previous effort, and adjust the implementation for your environment and unique concerns. Problem-solvers do this all the time; they take an existing solution and modify it as needed to fit the new need. No big deal. This is the normal way to solve a problem.

Problem solving is primarily achieved by looking at your palette of good concepts and solution patterns, picking a few to try, adjusting for the situation, and seeing what works best. 

This is why experienced people tend to be able to come up with more robust solutions, and it’s also why more junior people tend to come up with more radical or non-standard solutions. The experienced people have built a solution palette from their time in industry, the more junior people have a smaller palette mostly comprised of solutions observed outside industry.
Therefore - 

**Being better at solving problems is primarily a function of having more good concepts and solution patterns on your palette.** 

As with art, the more diverse your palette is, the prettier the painting can be. This is why it’s so important to gather wisdom from as many places as possible. Be on the lookout for good solution patterns, good concepts, good generics. Simply being exposed to them will make you a better problem solver.

With all of that out of the way, I will share some *Lessons from The Magic Kingdom* I’ve learned.
