Old: Buying the DevOps
#### "Buying the DevOps"

In the software development world, "DevOps" is the combination of "Development" and "Operations." The concept is pretty much just that - you should attempt to combine the product development and ongoing operation of the product as much as practical. Having separate divisions build the product and support the running product can lead to "blame games" when bad things happen, and generally hurt the quality of the product as a whole. 

On the surface, "DevOps" is a pretty clear concept. The people building your product should be working closely with the people who run and maintain the product and get it to the customers. 

DevOps encourages cross-training, because you want everyone to be able to do pretty much anything. That makes for a much more agile organization, if you need to scale up the Operations side because you have a lot more customers coming in, you can, or if you need to do more Development, you can. The Development done is more relevant to what Operations needs, because the development team has operational experience. The product ends up being more useful to the customer, because the development team, being exposed to operational situations, learns what the customer is using the product for and what issues they are having. Sunshine, rainbows, pots of gold. 

This all feeds into modern Agile development practices, which is covered in depth in other books. I'll say this: If you want to do Agile well, you need to do Continuous Integration well. Continuous Integration (and it's cousins, Continuous Deployment / Continuous Delivery) integrates changes from developers into the larger system, and with changes from other developers, as soon as practical so issues can be identified early and resolved early. This effectively pulls the developers into the operational environment because their changes end up in an operational system as they make them. There are tools and practices that help make this all happen in the software world, and it all stems from DevOps concepts.

All of this sounds excellent on the surface. Realities start setting in when you try to implement the concept, though. DevOps, fully embraced at the raw conceptual level, is a world-breaking departure from traditional business models.

No sane manager would say that the factory worker who assembled your car should also be the mechanic at your dealership and the person who puts gas in it. But according to pure, conceptual-level DevOps... *This is the way.* Software projects don't have the physical restrictions that physical projects do, but even there, mashing together roles and responsibilities have real, world-breaking impacts.

Because of the world-breaking nature of pure DevOps, there is no perfect way to implement it. It's just a concept you can work towards and realize some benefit along the way. Additionally, every product and situation is different. Therefore DevOps concepts have to be designed and applied thoughtfully and individually in each effort. This is another mind-bending issue, because project managers and engineers are used to implementing known solutions, with known costs, and known benefits. "DevOps" isn't that.

Implementing "DevOps" is too ambiguous to know how to determine its cost - and while there are some apparent benefits to having the development and operations teams work closely together, the *financial* benefits are pretty ambiguous also. This situation tends to trap organizations: They know they want to "do DevOps" but can't figure out what it will cost, or what benefit they will get. They don't know how to *"Buy the DevOps."* 

Because you can't Buy "the DevOps." It's not a thing you can buy.

DevOps isn't a single tool or process, it's a raw *concept.* The only way you can implement a *concept* is via organization-wide *culture.*
