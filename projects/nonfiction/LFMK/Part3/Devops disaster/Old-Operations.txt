## Part 2: Operations

We're jumping straight from Design to Operations. Shouldn't there be a step in between where we get some wisdom on how best to build the Product we've designed? Shouldn't there be a section on how to run a project that actively building something new scratch, or putting something new in the Product we already have?

1) This book is intended for all kinds of creation and problem solving. 

Implementation differs wildly depending on what kind of project you're doing. Sure, we could talk in metaphors, but I don't want to talk about building a house when you're working on building a software product, or vice-versa. 

2) Products are converging. 

How your Product gets built largely no longer matters, the product itself likely looks, acts, and is built much like your competitor's Products were. "Features" are no longer a differentiator, everyone has similar features. The differentiator today is how your Product is delivered and supported. *Operations* is where your solution will be better than the other solutions, not the product itself. 

*Mako* is a roller coaster at Sea World, a short drive from Walt Disney World. It is the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster in the Orlando area, at 200 feet high, 73 mile per hour top speed, and a track length of 4,760 feet. It's a very modern, smooth riding steel roller coaster that opened in 2016. 

Space Mountain at the Magic Kingdom opened in 1975. It's short, bumpy, uncomfortable, and has a top speed of 27 miles per hour. Objectively, as a bare steel roller coaster, Mako is better in every conceivable way - but due to how Space Mountain is
