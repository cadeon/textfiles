# Video Games

Yesterday Xander started listing off all the games he's played and beaten. I figured I should write down the more important games I can remember playing. 

## TI-99/4a
This was my first computer, plugged into a small black and white tv.
### 4A Flyer
This was my first flight sim. I don't think you can 'beat' a simulator, but I did fly and not crash. It was on a cartridge that plugged into the computer.
### Ghost Town
This was the first text adventure I ever played. Mom and I played it, as I wasn't the best at reading. I don't think we ever really finished it, but we got close - we had most of the elements needed to make an explosive and leave the town. This used an interesting setup where there was a cartridge that loaded an environment that could then load the story from cassette tape. You had to put the tape in a tape player, and press PLAY when the computer was ready to load it.
### Munchman
This was a TI Pac-man clone. It was okay. Never beat it, not sure if you can. This was on a cartridge.
### Tombstone
This was a weird, almost-Centipede-like, shooter. You moved around the screen and shot tumbleweeds and bugs. This was also on a cartridge.
### MAD magazine BASIC program
While not strictly a game, I did do a fair amount of basic programming on this machine, including painstakingly copying a big program published in MAD magazine. They didn't tel you what it did, so you had to just type it and find out. What did it do? Displayed a picture of Alfred E. Newman, the same picture seen being printed on the cover of that issue.

## Early IBM Clones 
Over the years we had lots of different computers in the house, beginning with an XT clone - with turbo button! - and a "you'll never fill this up" 40 megabyte hard disk. Notable machines include a Tandy 1000RLX, a generic 386, and later a 486. 
### Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator
I spent a lot of time with the original release and the "2.0" release. "2.0" barely ran on the XT, and I remember how turning "on" the turbo button made the simulation run noticeably *worse*. Many years later I learned the turbo button was there to *disable* the higher clock speed the chip ran at by default, in order to keep compatibility with software that was meant to run at the original IBM-spec 8mhz. There's no way to "beat" a simulator game, but I did do pretty well flying stuff with these games.
### Wordperfect 5
Not a game (a word processor), but a piece of software I used a lot, as early as elementary school. My handwriting was horrible, so I figured out I could just type my homework instead, and that way I was less likely to get comments about my bad handwriting. 
### Lightspeed
Lightspeed was a space colony simulation, where you're flying a colony ship looking for the resources you need to start a new human colony on a new planet. It was surprisingly deep, and included many alien races, trading, and outright diplomacy in addition to combat to do well. Interplay released it a few times, sometimes under different names. I remember there were two difficulty levels. The game played the same in both difficulties, but in the harder difficulty the cluster of stars and planets to explore was much, much larger. I completed the smaller cluster several times, and I *think* I completed the large cluster once.
### Stunts
This was a build-your-own-track racing game released in 1990, and I spent *years* messing with it. I found bugs I could exploit - you can "lock" the indycar at top speed - I beat the story mode many times, and I built tracks and gave them to friends. It was a *very* popular game at school (we all got our copies there), even in late high school (1997, 98) people were playing it in programming class after they got their stuff done. Stunts is well known in the retro PC games space and well worth a try, it's really amazing how well the cars drive using just arrow keys to control them. That said, don't confuse Stunts with-
### Stunt Car Driver
Stunt Car Driver came out the same year as Stunts, and I remember having a *boxed* copy of it. It was good, and very similar in concept to "Stunts", but just lacked a little bit on the execution, particularly with respect to how the car felt to drive. I also remember having trouble getting it to run reliably. 
### Microsoft Flight Simulator 3
This was an incredibly complex game for me when I got ahold of it. Most of my memories of this game are me sitting on the runway in a Boeing something trying to figure out where the throttle is. I did eventually get pretty good at Microsoft flight simulator and played many different releases of it over the years.
### Falcon 3.0 Gold and 4.0
This was another flight simulator that was focused on the F-16 Falcon. It was intended to be very realistic with planned missions, etc. The book that came with the game was 3 inches thick. I did fly missions, and successfully shoot down other planes, etc, but I never really got into the campaign mode (it required too much reading and felt very restrictive). One big memory is hearing the radio audio - which was super cool at the time - saying "Request you check joker." Eventually I looked it up, apparently my wingmen were telling me we were low on fuel.
### Descent (1,2,3)
The Descent series was flying ships through mining shafts in moons and asteroids where the robots doing the mining had decided to revolt. There's more to the story than that, but that's all I bothered to learn. Go blow up the robots. 
Descent 1 was amazing and I spent a lot of time with it. I don't think I ever completed the game, but that was never my goal. I was there to fly a spaceship around and shoot things.
Descent 2 was a refinement on Descent 1, with some new levels. I wasn't terribly impressed as it felt like largely the same game.
Descent 3 was a whole new thing (at least it looked and felt that way). It really pushed the hardware I had at the time, being one of the first games (in my experience) to *really* lean on OpenGL and other 3d graphics capabilities. It was also the first game I ever played "online." Uncle Jerry and I played over the modem, directly dialing each other (and paying long distance fees). We typically played a straight deathmatch, because we couldn't play cooperatively because we couldn't talk to each other- the phone line was in use for data. He almost always won.
### Id Software
Yea I played all the Id stuff.
#### Wolfenstein 3D
I played wolf3d. It was, and kinda still is, a staple. Granny Shirley liked playing wolf3d, she particularly enjoyed the chaingun. Wolf3d was also the first game I ever modified - I found a patch that swapped out Hitler with Barney the dinosaur, even changing the paintings, stained glass, and sounds with purple dinosaur versions. Years later, there was a remake of Wolfenstein, but I wasn't aware of it until I was already at a LAN party. People were talking about playing Wolfenstein multiplayer, but I told them I didn't know there was a multiplayer mode. I actually downloaded original wolf3d to look for this "multiplayer mode" before someone pointed out there was a new remake everyone was playing instead of the original. I did complete wolfenstein 3d several times, but typically with mods or cheats.
#### Doom
I played a fair amount of Doom. I never completed the game, but I got very interested in the technology and did a lot of modding. I eventually started making my own levels, including building a correct scale (down to about 3/4 of an inch) of the screen room we were building on the back of the house, complete with hot tub. I wanted to build the whole house, but I never did. I didn't play Doom II at all, really.
#### Heretic, Hexen, Rise of the Triad, Duke3d, etc.
Yea I played the other ones too, but I never really got into any of them. I did a little bit of modding / tinkering with Heretic, but nothing like what I did with Doom.
#### Papyrus Racing Games
NASCAR Racing 1 and 2, Indycar Racing got played a lot. I ran a full-length race at Talladega in NASCAR Racing 1, and won. I think that's enough to call that game "beaten."

## Early Consoles
### Colecovision
I played Turbo on the Coleco, and I thought it was amazing. I was terrible at qbert, but played that too. 
### Atari 2600
Circus Atari, Video Pinball, Asteroids, Pac-Man (terrible port),  Pitfall, and Combat among many others. Combat was particularly memorable because I would often play with another person (it was meant to be two player), which was fun. Mom is pretty good at Combat. Sometimes I would play Combat in two player, but by myself, so I could figure out the mechanics of the game. Some modes would allow projectiles to bounce off walls. I got good at those kinds of shots. I also remember playing breakout at Uncle Jerry's house, and routinely forgetting to turn off the system before removing the cartridge.
### NES
Goodness.
#### Mario
I never got good at any of the Mario games. I did beat Super Mario 1, 2, and 3 using the Game Genie. The Game Genie was so much fun to learn, it introduced me to how memory addresses work. 
#### NES Play Action Football
I played a lot of Football, including many after-school sessions with a kid named Peter in elementary school. A few years later we ran into each other at middle school. He had gotten so much taller and bigger I didn't recognize him. He was super frustrated that I didn't know who he was, and I genuinely didn't. It was *weeks* later before I realized I had failed to recognize a friend. I haven't seen him since then. 
That said, I feel like I "beat" NES Play Action Football. I played as all the teams and generally won games against the CPU.
#### Destination: Earthstar
Aunt Jean bought me this game for my 7th birthday, which was the birthday that I also got the NES itself. I opened her present first, and *didn't know* what it was, because I didn't have an NES. It looked cool, though, because it had a spaceship on it. I feel bad, because I wasn't initially happy to get the present, because I didn't know what it was. After I got the NES later that day, I played a lot of Earthstar, and really liked it. It was an incredibly difficult space simulator game, and I never made it far before losing. The reviews for this game are harsh, which is understandable... it's really not a well made game. But I liked it, and it reminds me of Aunt Jean.
#### Tetris
Well, yea.
#### Dr. Mario
I didn't play this nearly as much as my dad did, but I loved watching him play. Every now and then we'd play two player, and I'd lose. That was fine, the music was good, the colors were pretty, and it was fun to play a game. At the time I didn't understand why my dad played so much Dr. Mario, which looked like a silly, simple game with no story. Now, later in life, I completely understand why an adult would want to play a silly, simple game with no story. Doing so can fix the entire day.
#### Others
I would borrow NES games, *rent* NES games, and play NES games at other kid's houses. Excitebike and RC Pro Am were really popular with my friends. Probably my favorite rental cartridge was *Paperboy*.
### Sega Genesis
The Sega was more popular with my friends than it was in my house. Eventually I got my own Sega in my room, and later in life I've had various Sega cartridges and even a Genesis 3 I managed to find and buy new. I played the Sonic games, a *lot* of NBA Jam, and a few various others including Virtua Racing. The main interest I had in the Sega systems was the technology, not so much the games.
### Playstation 1
I played Spyro 1 and 2 on the PSX. But let's be real, here, it's all about-
#### Gran Turismo 2
I never played the original Gran Turismo, but I did play a ton of the "simulation mode" disc of Gran Turismo 2. This game introduced me to the car world, and helped me understand how cars work, how they drive, and what modifications can be made to cars. I spent *weeks* trying to figure out what I was missing, because the "game progress percentage" was stuck at 98.2%. Turns out I had an early copy of the game which had bugs, including the percentage complete bug. 98.2% was 100%. I very, very much beat Gran Turismo 2. 
To this day I still love the Gran Turismo series. The commitment to quality of presentation in these games has certainly influenced me, the cars have (of course), and even the soundtracks of all the games have inspired what music I like today.
### Original Xbox
The draw to the Xbox was the technology side for me. I loved taking these machines, modding them, and running all kinds of different software on them. I built an Xbox into an arcade cabinet and used it to run the emulators for the arcade, I built Xboxes that could copy games from disc to their internal hard drive, and I built Xboxes... that bricked themselves. 
For Xbox games, I liked the Jet Set Radio Future game, Star Wars Battlefront II, Tetris Worlds, the Burnout games, and I played (and beat) Forza Motorsport.
### Playstation 2
The first time I touched a PS2 was when my parents rented one for my "going to flight school" party. It was super early in the PS2's life cycle, and so there weren't many good games on it yet. They had rented a flying game with it, which I remember looked very good and flew smoothly, but overall didn't have much  content. I didn't get a PS2 until much later (after I got married!), at which point there were many games and mods available. 
A lot of my PS2 time was spent on modding the console and just seeing what I could get to run. I eventually built a couple PS2s with hard drives and games installed. As usual for me, it was less about playing the games, and more about building the systems.
#### Gran Turismo 3 and 4
GT4 is one of the best ones ever made.
#### The Getaway
This was a third person crime-in-london game. It was perhaps the first compelling story-driven game I really got into. Everyone else was playing Grand Theft Auto.
#### Disgaea
This was the first turn-based game I got into. I still love Disgaea and play the newer games when I can, and occasionally revisit the original.
### Sega Dreamcast
I got a Dreamcast at the very end of the console's life, because it got very, very cheap. It's a really interesting piece of hardware and I did a few interesting things with it, aside from playing a *lot* of Chu Chu Rocket.
#### Linux
I ran full Linux on the Dreamcast, by cross-compiling it from scratch for the Dreamcast hardware. I was able to turn it into a  fully usable computer, using the official Dreamcast keyboard, mouse, and ethernet adaptor. At one point I used the machine at work to help generate network traffic while we were building a firewall. And yes, it ran Doom. 
#### Marvel vs Capcom 2 - Soundtrack replacement
I replaced the music soundtrack, and a couple sounds, on Marvel vs Capcom 2 for the Dreamcast. I used Michael Jackson's "Bad" for the character select screen, and various popular songs for the individual stages. The best replacement was the title screen music, which I swapped out for the Rocky and Bullwinkle theme. Unfortunately, the TV I was using died during the effort, so I wasn't able to clean up the audio further (there was some distortion due to volume) - but I did manage to capture a video of the intro - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbnwNYXaLSY
### Portables
#### Game Gear
I had a Sega Game Gear for a while, and played Chase HQ along with a Sonic game. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the games, and the battery life of the system was horrible, and the screen - while color - wasn't good. 
#### Gameboy
I never had an original Gameboy or Gameboy Color. I played some of those games in emulation, or on Gameboy Advance systems.
#### Gameboy Advance
I had a late-production Gameboy Advance SP, the "super bright" one. I also briefly had a Gameboy Micro while I was traveling a lot. These are amazing handhelds. I played a lot of Metroid and Advance Wars.
#### Nintendo DS series
I had an original DS, a 3DS XL, and (currently) a new 2DS. I like these systems but have not played them a lot, as usual I find the technology interesting but tend to lack time to invest in the games themselves. I like having the new 2DS around, especially for travel. I've played Zelda, Starfox, and Animal Crossing games. Currently my 2DS is set up to run homebrew and has a huge library of emulated games available on it. Setting that up was more fun than playing the games.
#### PSP
I have had a couple of PSPs, and currently have one. These are very interesting pieces of hardware, and I've done a lot with them. I've done remote access via PSP, talked on the phone via Skype, and, of course, played games. The most time I've spent with a PSP game has been in the Disgaea series of games, they are very nice to have in your pocket. 
#### Playstation Vita
I've had a Vita *twice* and both times I decided to get rid of it fairly quickly. It's an amazing system, but the software support just isn't there, and in many ways it's simply too complex for its own good. Last time I owned a Vita I bought it for a long train trip. I found out during the trip that it wasn't particularly good to travel with, which was the whole purpose of having it. On the train, without reliable internet access, it wouldn't let me play all the games I had installed. It left the collection shortly after I got back. 
#### Playstation TV
The Vita-based PSTV was an interesting tiny console. I had one for quite a while and liked it, particularly for remote play from the PS4 and PS3. It suffered from some of the same complexities the Vita does, though, and eventually I gave up on it.

### Early Consoles Notably missing
#### SNES
I never played much Super Nintendo. I did own one, long after it had been discontinued, as part of a game collecting effort. Amy and I played a fair amount of Tetris Attack, but not much else.
#### Sega Master System
I didn't know this thing existed until I was an adult. I always assumed Sega's first console was the Genesis. I've played some Master System games, and, well, now I know why I didn't know about this system at all. 
#### Sega Saturn
I've played a Saturn a few times, and I feel it was really ambitious and generally a cool system, but just undercooked while also too complex. It's got the same kind of issues the Vita has, it's just not quite a complete product.
#### Nintendo 64
I never had one growing up, never really had much interest in it. I briefly had one when I was collecting consoles, but I noticed I didn't play anything on it. I was really turned off by the amount of fog the system uses to keep the rendering load down. There are really good games on the N64, most of which have been ported to the 3DS/2DS. I've played a lot of them there.

## "Modern" Consoles
### Playstation 3

The PS3 launched about the same time I started to really get into Formula 1. There was an F1 game as a launch title that looked amazing, especially the rain. That, combined with the unique hardware the PS3 had (which let me geek out in it), the promise of backwards-compatibility, and the promise of *a game console being able to run linux* - I was sold. The PS3 was the only console I was an "early adopter" of. I bought that sucker at launch. 

I played a lot of games, but the PS3 also was the device of choice for netflix streaming, which was also showing up around that time. Unfortunately, the early, backwards-compatible PS3s were prone to "yellow light of death" due to overheating. That, combined with marathon netflix sessions, we melted a lot of PS3s. In general, Sony replaced them, but eventually the replacements were not the original, backwards-compatible units. 

I cycled through many PS3 hardware units and did lots of things with them. I used the "Other OS" feature to run several different versions of linux. Once Other OS was removed, I participated in the class action suit and received like $20 or something for that. 

#### Formula 1 Championship Edition

F1 game, launch title, fun for me but not incredibly popular. I really enjoyed playing as a Super Aguri driver. 

#### All the other games

LittleBigPlanet, Ratchet and Clank, fl0w, and omg rock band

#### Rockband

I played a bunch of rockband (and guitar hero, previously) on the PS3. Got pretty much all the games, got lots of DLC, and thankfully the songs were exportable up to the PS4. 

#### Gran Turismo 5 and 6

5 was a new engine, so the game kinda lacked. Gran Turismo 6 was the best GT game ever. Gran Turismo 7 looks like it may be a return to form, but I don't think I'm going to be getting a PS5, so I'll skip that. 

#### Remote play / PSP

The PS3 introduced me to remote play, which interested me a lot. It didn't have a ton of support, because it required processing resources. The PS4 separated out the streaming / remoteplay functionality, so more is supported.

### Playstation 4

Naturally, it made sense to go to the PS4, especially when rockband 4 came out. Dove into rockband 4 hard. Most of the other games were, honestly, lackluster. Gran Turismo on the PS4, in particular, was a let-down. I do not think I'll be getting a PS5. 

The uncharted series was fun, but it was on the PS3 first - and I didn't manage to finish any of the games. 

#### Tetris Effect Review

Omg. This game is amazing. I wrote my own review on it, which I will post here. 

> It’s weird to say this, but Tetris Effect ( https://youtu.be/PFVL6t8IHE8 ) is the game that finally made me alright with owning a PlayStation 4. It’s so beyond good. 
>
> Usually people talk about some AAA-system-selling-multiplayer-online-action game when they justify owning a game system. They’d never admit that a simple “baby” game like Tetris is the thing.
>
> Don’t get me wrong, I have a couple of those “amazing” system exclusive games, too. And they’re nice. But I haven’t seen anything yet that brings everything together *right* like Tetris Effect does. The simplicity of Tetris just “goes with” sitting somewhere comfortable, away from a desk, and just enjoying a game.
>
> Games these days are too much like work. You’ve got to download patches and DLC  You’ve got to manage things. You have to remember button combinations. You have to deal with other people, because all the games are online now. One of the reasons I tend to like racing games is that they are simpler by default- you’re not going to be managing inventory why driving (usually). You just play the game. I try to get into modern games, but the commitment is just too high. Tetris Effect isn’t that; it’s just Tetris, it’s simple... but done with modern hardware and incredible atmosphere.
>
> I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, though. The thing that sold me on the PS3 was fl0w ( https://youtu.be/TwcYJdp4OjA ). 
>
> I think the complexity of modern games is a big part of why retro gaming is such a big thing. In pursuit of making the best, most engaging games possible, the industry as a whole lost their way. It turned into feature chasing instead of fun. Competition is everywhere in technology, especially in gaming. It was (and still is) super important for games to one-up the other guy and try and prove they are “worth” the money they ask for. 
>
> Being “worth it” actually kept me from buying Tetris Effect for a long time. I was interested in it when it was announced, but I didn’t buy it until it had been out for a couple years, and only then when it was on sale. I felt bad when I bought it, because “it’s just Tetris.” The industry has taught me to expect more, they’ve taught me that I need to focus on features and technology instead of fun. I’m glad I saw past that programming this time. 
>
> Sure, modern games are fun. Modern simulations (and simulation games) are amazing. I really enjoy those, too. But pick-up-and-play simplicity, especially combined with an abstract puzzle ( as opposed to no-room-for-imagination simulated environments ), can’t be beat. That’s Tetris Effect. Highly recommended. 

### Nintendo Switch

We ended up with three switches in the house. Everybody likes the switch. 

## "Modern" PC Games
This is also todo
