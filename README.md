Stuff here is "organized" into folders however it makes sense to me at the moment. I'm using IA Writer for most of the content creation, and it supports using hashtags to create other relations between content. Generally these tags will be at the bottom of the document.

Migration will take a while, but I intend to move all of my content here, and then possibly drive online blogs or other online presence out of this repository. 

If, for some reason, you find some of this content useful, please let me know and follow the license.
