## Content organization
Stuff here is "organized" into folders however it makes sense to me at the moment. 
### Hashtags
I'm using IA Writer for most of the content creation, and it supports using hashtags to create other relations between content. These tags will be at the bottom of the document.
### Links to other files
IA Writer will render files inline if you link to them by writing the path and file name. When you see file names inline in text files, that's where that other file should be placed to complete the document. Github's renderer does not do this include by default, but other markdown tools do. 

## Migration
Migration will take a while, but I intend to move all of my content here, and then possibly drive online blogs or other online presence out of this repository. Sources include my medium, various Wordpresses, and local files nobody has ever seen.

## Use
If, for some reason, you find some of this content useful, please let me know and follow the license.
